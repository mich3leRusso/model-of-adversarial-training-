Generalization covers an important topic on neural networks training, that represents its ability to abstract significant information for classification, giving a training set ; hence to the capability to classify properly unseen data, that is the set of patterns with which the network has not been trained. The development of these technologies plays a crucial role, as it is useful to reach the state of the art models. This is inspired by the MaxUp technique, which offers an improvement of the generalization performance through the use of Augmented Data and Adversarial Training. Several tests including various datasets were carried out, especially on pictures and histopathology recognition. The aim of this work is to demonstrate how Data Augmentation and Adversaria Training could increase performances on generalization and improve robustness on methods.
